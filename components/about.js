                    Our aim is to list all active flat-track, WFTDA rules roller derby leagues in the UK and show where they train or play to make it easier to find teams near you to join or play against.

                <Typography sx={{ mt: 2 }}>
                    The list has been compiled and refined over several years and we believe it to be a fairly accurate picture of roller derby in the UK. However, if you notice any discrepancies or would like to bring a new league to our attention, please e-mail <Link href="mailto;contact@rollerderbyleagues.co.uk">contact@rollerderbyleagues.co.uk</Link> with the details.
